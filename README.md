# VisionGrid Chrome Extension

## Overview

VisionGrid is a Google Chrome extension designed to enhance the way you manage design inspiration websites. Unlike default bookmarks that lack visual representation, VisionGrid allows you to bookmark a page and view all your bookmarks with accompanying images on an external page. Moreover, you can categorize your bookmarks with tags such as SAAS, Ecommerce, Portfolio, Minimal, Colorful, Landingpage, StartUp, Dark, WebApp, making it easier to organize and retrieve your inspirations.
